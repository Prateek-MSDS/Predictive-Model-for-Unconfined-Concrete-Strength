# A DATA CURATION SYSTEM AND PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR UNCONFINED CONCRETE STRENGTH

By : Prateek Kakkar, Ramgopal Reddy Putta and, Xuanzhi Li 

This project aims to improve data management in the construction industry by providing a comprehensive solution that delivers clean data and the development of a machine learning model to predict concrete strength and understand the key factors affecting it. The team, consisting of Data Science graduate students at Seattle University and liaising with a leading structural engineering firm, DeSimone Consulting Engineering, establishes a feasible approach demonstrating the potential for using technology to improve data management processes in the construction industry and will provide a comprehensive solution for the company's data analysis challenges. The solution extracts data from PDF files and transforms it into a structured format. The team then develops a machine learning model to predict concrete strength based on the extracted data. This project enables the construction company to have better insights into concrete strength and its influential variables, make better business decisions, and improve the overall efficiency of their operations.

### Repo Information:

_DCE_Reports_Scraper.ipynb:_ This notebook reads the information from an Excel file containing the paths of the PDF reports to be scraped and exports three clean and structured Excel files.

_Prediction_Model_Generator.ipynb:_ This notebook showcases how the prediction model was built for this problem and evaluates its performance.

_DCE_predictive_model.pkl:_ This is the final model used for prediction.

_Predict_Unconfined_Concrete_Strength.ipynb:_ This notebook predicts the strength based on the given 11 variables.

_Visualization.ipynb:_ This notebook provides visual represenation of data.
